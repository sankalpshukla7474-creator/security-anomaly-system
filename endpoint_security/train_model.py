# --- Step 2: Prepare the Data for the AI ---
# Neural networks work best when all numbers are small, usually between 0 and 1.
# MinMaxScaler is the perfect tool for this.
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df)

# We will use our "normal" data for both training and testing the reconstruction.
# We split the data so we can train on one part and validate on another unseen part.

# --- Step 3: Build the Autoencoder Model (The Brain's Architecture) ---
# We define the number of features our data has.

    # Input layer: Takes our data
    layers.Input(shape=(n_features,)),

    layers.Dense(4, activation='relu'), # Smaller than n_features
    # Decoder: This layer tries to reconstruct the original data from the compressed version
    layers.Dense(n_features, activation='sigmoid') # Must be same size as input
])

# Compile the model, telling it how to learn.
# 'adam' is a smart learning algorithm.
# 'mae' (Mean Absolute Error) is how we will measure the "reconstruction error".
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mae')
model.summary() # Prints a summary of the model architecture

# --- Step 4: Train the Model ---
print("\nStarting model training... This might take several minutes.")
# We 'fit' the model to our training data.
# epochs=50 means the model will look at the entire dataset 50 times.
# batch_size=32 means it will process data in chunks of 32 rows.
# validation_data allows us to see how well it performs on the test data it hasn't seen.

    shuffle=True,
    verbose=1 # This will show a progress bar

# --- Step 5: Visualize the Learning Process ---
